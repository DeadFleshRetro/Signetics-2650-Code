ABOUT

The Voltmace Database development system was created by Derek Andrews in 2021.

The core of the system is an assembler for the Signetics 2650 microprocessor. Work flow progresses seemlessly through edit, assemble, dump and view listing.

It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi400 and connects to the games console via the GPIO port and an interface board which comprises some glue logic and one (or more) dual-port RAMs.

Currently the prototype interface board has one dual-port 4k RAM chip which emulates a ROM for the console. This will gradually be expanded to 8k, with the option of configuring part of the top 4k to behave as RAM for the console.

It should be straightforward to adapt it to work on other software compatible consoles, and possibly the Emerson Arcadia. 


The editor and assembler should work standalone. On other platforms such as Windows it requires a mock GPIOzero.py module.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This project would never have happened without a vast amount of information, inspiration and serendipity.

The late Tony Pearmain who hired me to write video games at Voltmace.

The websites I discovered a couple of decades later that had information about the Voltmace Database and who interviewed me.

The eBay seller who recognized my name and sent me not one but two consoles at a very favourable price.

James Jacobs for his vast collection of information about the consoles and games, and for the WinArcadia emulator that I have been working with until now.

Chris Dymond, aka Dead Flesh Retro for his enthusiasm for this family of consoles and motivating me to actually do this.

All the content creators on the web that have helped me learn enough Python and Tkinter to be able to write this software, particularly on YouTube and StackOverflow.
